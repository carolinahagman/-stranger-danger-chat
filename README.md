## Assignment

A school assignment to write a Laravel application of our own choosing.

We have chosen to make a randomized chat.

## Requirments

<details><summary><strong>The application should contain the following features of Laravel:</strong></b></summary>
- Controllers
- Migrations
- HTTP Tests (on all routes)
- Laravel Mix
- Middleware
- Models (with relationships)
- Routes (with route model binding)
- Eloquent
- Relationships
- Validation
- Views (Blade)
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Requirments:</strong></b></summary>
- The application idea should be discussed with the teacher and be given an OK before you get started.
- Each group should write a code review of at least 20 comments on the next groups project the day before presentations.
- The code syntax must adhere to the PSR-12 standard. If not, your project wont be approved and you'll get an extra assignment.
- Install the [Clockwork](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork) extension in order to find issues such as [N+1 problem](https://laracasts.com/lessons/eager-loading) in your Laravel application.
- Oh, by the way, you can't use any fancy-pantzy JavaScript frameworks, **this is a backend assignment**. If you do want to write JavaScript it should be vanilla and just some basic stuff. Discuss this with your teacher.
